Abstract: In this letter, we propose dual-mode chirp spread spectrum (DM-CSS) modulation for low-power wide-area networks. DM-CSS is capable of achieving a higher spectral efficiency (SE) relative to its counterparts, such as Long Range (LoRa) modulation. Considering the same symbol period, the SE in DM-CSS are augmented by: (i) simultaneously multiplexing even and odd chirp signals; (ii) using phase shifts of 0 and Ï€ radians for both even and odd chirp signals; and (iii) using either up-chirp or down-chirp signal. The SE increases by up to 116.66% for the same bandwidth and spreading factor relative to LoRa. We present a complete transceiver architecture along with non-coherent detection process. Simulation results reveal that DM-CSS is not only more spectral efficient but also more energy efficient than most classical counterparts. It is also demonstrated that DM-CSS is robust to phase and frequency offsets.
